    author: 'Mary Shelley',
    description: 'One of the best-known Gothic novels, Frankenstein is both a haunting, uncanny novel about the dangers and temptations of scientific progress and an enduring investigation into what it means to be truly human. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein—more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.Obsessed by creating life itself, Victor Frankenstein plunders graveyards for the material to fashion a new being, which he shocks into life by electricity. But his botched creature, rejected by Frankenstein and denied human companionship, sets out to destroy his maker and all that he holds dear. The result of a compact (when Mary Shelley was just nineteen years old) between Mary, her husband Percy and Lord Byron one stormy night to write their own haunting stories, Frankenstein remains essential reading today. Influenced by the myth of Prometheus and Milton’s Paradise Lost, this chilling gothic tale would become the world\'s most famous work of horror fiction, and continues to be a devastatingly relevant exploration of the limits of human creativity.',

Her Malbry series - based around the exploits at St Oswald\'s Grammar school in the fictional town of Malbry - plays perfectly to Harris\'s strengths, combining deft characterisation with a typically nuanced, multi-layered narrative.

His third novel, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, secured him a worldwide reputation, which was consolidated by the acclaim for his trilogy Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, The Honourable Schoolboy and Smiley\'s People all featuring his most famous character, George Smiley, the quintessential Cold War operative. An antidote to Fleming’s racier James Bond, Smiley is cool, thoughtful, somewhat academic and (superficially) “breathtakingly normal” with a somewhat ambivalent attitude to the Service and its efficacy. His other novels, thrillers which range widely covering variously political issues of the arms trade, modern conflict and drug-trafficking, include: A Most Wanted Man, Our Kind of Traitor, A Delicate Truth and the recently adapted The Night Manager. His only work of non-fiction, The Pigeon Tunnel, was a Number One bestseller in 2016.',
